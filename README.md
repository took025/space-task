# Frontend Test space

first of all run npm install to instal node modules,

next run ng-serve to execute project,

and then `json-server --watch db.json` for a dev server.

after all of them you can see da result

comment : i couldnot make the same as taks bc of json server. that to go the group and give the roles that contains, i couldnot reach his child array object and that was the reason, with back-end developer i would do that easilly.
